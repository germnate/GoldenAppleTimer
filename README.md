# Golden Apple Timer

## What is a Golden Apple Timer?

A Golden Apple Timer is a Pomodoro Timer. Pomodoro in italian means "tomato", but literally translated it means "golden apple".

## What is a Pomdoro Timer?

A Pomodoro Timer is a time management technique that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. The method is designed to enhance focus and productivity by promoting sustained concentration and regular rest periods.

The idea behind the Pomodoro Technique is simple: work in short, focused bursts with breaks to prevent burnout and improve efficiency

I came across this project https://timer.flotes.app and really enjoyed using it. I decided to build it myself with a slight twist of being able to create your own playlist instead of relying on youtube or spotify. 

## How Do I use it?

Upload your music to the browser and create a personalized study playlist, along with a single track to play during your break. Simply click the "Start" button on the timer, and your playlist will play seamlessly while you work. When it's time for a break, the music will pause and resume after your break ends.

Use the tasks lists to set your goals for the study session.
